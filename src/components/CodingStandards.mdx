# Standards

The below are the `Standards` that are laid out for the entire team to follow while writing or committing any code to the repository.

These set of rules are in place to ensure that there is `consistency` and `standards` that are maintained within the team and all are following off the same-page.

This enables us to `onboard` any new member to the team and removes any or all ambiguity around how we structure our application code and maintain it.

If you want to contribute to this living document. Please raise a `Pull Request` mentioning the `why`, `what` and `how` about the standards we want to add to this document to give a rationale behind the rules.
